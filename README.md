# Mokkalog

Hello, Mokkalog has been a fun project for me to combine what I love: app development and clothing. It was also a great way for me to learn a lot of skills that I didn't know before. 

Things you may want to cover:

* I never really intended this to be for public viewing so please excuse my syntaxes and nonsensical commit messages

* Searching and Filtering with Ransack
* Multiple step form submission (brand_onboarding_controller) 
* Pagination
