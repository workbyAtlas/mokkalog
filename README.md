# Mokkalog

Hello, Mokkalog has been a fun project for me to combine what I love: app development and clothing. It was also a great way for me to learn a lot of skills that I didn't know before. 

Things you may want to cover:

* I have been using this project to self learn ruby on rails and was not my intention to make this project public, so please excuse my syntaxes and such. (one of the big reason why I decided to start a new project at molla.ai trying to get rid of all the techical debt I have acquired in this project)
* The spirit of Mokkalog has moved on to [molla.ai](https://molla.ai) so check us out there!

Skills I learned working on this project
* devise - confirmable, lockable, registerable
* Friendly URL
* Basic SEO (google mokkalog)
* User Session Tracking(help with gem ahoy)
* Searching and Filtering with Ransack
* Multiple step form submission (brand_onboarding_controller) 
* Pagination 
* Designing Components (UI/UX)
* Honeypot Forms
* Setting up Email Management
